# Logic Gate Simulator

## Introduction

This Logic Gate Simulator is an interactive web application designed to help users understand and visualize the behavior of basic logic gates. Inspired by concepts from digital electronics and devices, this project aims to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical understanding of logic gates.

## Motivation

This project was born out of the fascinating world of digital electronics and devices. As I delved into the fundamentals of digital systems, I realized the power and ubiquity of logic gates in modern computing. This simulator is my attempt to create a hands-on, visual tool that makes these abstract concepts more tangible and accessible to learners at all levels.

## Features

- Interactive simulation of five basic logic gates: AND, OR, NOT, NAND, and NOR
- Real-time visual representation of gate behavior
- Interactive input switches for easy manipulation
- Color-coded input and output lines for clear state visualization
- Truth table display for each gate type
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- HTML5
- CSS3
- SVG for gate visualizations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v12.0 or later)
- npm (v6.0 or later)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```

git clone https://github.com/swe-robertkibet/logic-gate-simulator.git

```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```

cd logic-gate-simulator

```

3. Install dependencies:

```

npm install

```

4. Start the development server:

```

npm start

```

5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

1. Select a logic gate type from the dropdown menu
2. Toggle the input switches to change the input states
3. Observe the real-time changes in the gate visualization and output
4. Refer to the truth table for a comprehensive view of all possible states

## Contributing
